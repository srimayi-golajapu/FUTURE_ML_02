## Problem Statement
Businesses need accurate sales forecasts to plan inventory, staffing, and cash flow. This project predicts future sales using historical time-based data while maintaining interpretability and business relevance.

## Project Structure

data

Raw sales dataset

notebooks

Data preparation and feature engineering

Model training and evaluation

Forecast visualization

## Limitations

Promotions, holidays, and external factors are not explicitly modeled

Forecast accuracy may decrease during unexpected events

Baseline model may not capture complex nonlinear patterns

## Future Enhancements

Add lag and rolling window features

Incorporate holiday and promotion data

Experiment with advanced forecasting models

Deploy forecasts using a dashboard or API
